**Agentic kubectl** - AI-powered Kubernetes operations

k8x is an intelligent CLI tool that acts as an AI-powered layer on top of `kubectl`. It helps you manage Kubernetes resources through natural language commands and provides intelligent troubleshooting capabilities.

## Features

- 🤖 **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions about your cluster in plain English
- 🔄 **Autonomous Execution**: AI agent executes safe kubectl commands automatically
- 🔍 **Intelligent Diagnostics**: AI-powered troubleshooting and resource analysis
- 📚 **Command History**: Automatic tracking with undo support
- 🔌 **Multi-LLM Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and other providers
- 🛡️ **Secure by Default**: Read-only mode with command filtering
- 🎯 **Context-Aware**: Understands cluster state and provides relevant suggestions

## Quick Start

### Release v0.1.1

```bash
# Homebrew (recommended)
brew tap aihero/k8x
brew install k8x

k8x --version


# To upgrade
brew update          # fetches the latest tap and core metadata
brew upgrade k8x     # upgrades only k8x (leaving other formulae untouched)
```

### Setup

1. **Initialize configuration:**

   ```bash
   k8x config init
   ```

2. **Add your LLM API key to ~/.k8x/credentials:**

   ```bash
   vim ~/.k8x/credentials
   ```

3. **Start using k8x:**

   ```bash
   k8x -c "are all pods running?"
   # Or
   k8x run "are all pods running?"
   # Or
   k8x command "are all pods running?"
   ```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Diagnose pod issues
k8x -c "Find all pods that are not ready and explain why"

# Resource analysis
k8x -c "Check resource usage across all namespaces"

# Service troubleshooting
k8x -c "Diagnose why my service endpoints are empty"

# View command history
k8x history list
```
